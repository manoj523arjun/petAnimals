Perfect for urban homes, or for country living, the Exotic is plush and beautiful to look at, with the added benefit of being one of the more affectionate breeds.

The grace of a jungle cat is held as one of the positive characteristics, along with the ability to move quietly and with stealth. The back legs are slightly longer than the front legs, making the hind end a bit higher than the shoulders, and emphasizing the Bengal's wild-cat appearance. The Bengal's muscular, athletic build is one of its most defining features; it is never delicate.",
